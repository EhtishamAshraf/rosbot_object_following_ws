/*
This ROS node is controlling the movement of the rosbot_2r robot based on object detection results 
provided by the `find_object_2d` package. 

Remember: Before running this node, Run the `object_teaching.launch` file with `teach` argument 
set as "true", to save images of the objects for recognition using find_object_2d pkg.

The node performs the following functions:
1. **Subscribes to the `/objects` topic, where it receives data about detected objects in the environment. 
Each detected object has an associated ID, which indicates the type of object recognized by the robot.

2. **Movement Control Based on Object ID**:
   - Object ID 4 (Speed_up):    The robot moves forward with a defined linear velocity.
   - Object ID 5 (Stop):        The robot stops moving.
   - Object ID 6 (Bottle_can):  The robot rotates in place with a defined angular velocity.
   
3. **Default Behavior: The robot will continue to rotate and move slowly forward to search for objects. 

The node continuously publishes `geometry_msgs::Twist` messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic to control the robotâ€™s movement.
