/*
This ROS node is adjusting the movement of the rosbot_2r robot based on object detection results 
provided by the `find_object_2d` package so that the robot is always focused on the center of the object. 

Remember: Before running this node, Run the `object_detection.launch` file with `teach` argument 
set as "true", to save images of the objects for recognition using find_object_2d pkg.

The node performs the following functions:
1. **Subscribes to the `/objects` topic, where it receives data about detected objects in the environment. 
   The object having an ID = 5 is the object which the robot will follow

2. **Movement Control Based on Object ID**:
   - Once the object is detected, corners of the object are stored in inPts vector.
   - Homography matrix is also fetched from the information published on the /objects topic.
   - PerspectiveTransformation is used to transform points from image plane to camera frame. 
   - So that the position of the object is known w.r.t the robot which could be used to follow the object.
   
3. **Default Behavior: The robot will continue to rotate to search for about detected objects in the environment. 
   The object having an ID = 5 is the object which the robot will follow with ID = 5. 

The node continuously publishes `geometry_msgs::Twist` messages to the `/cmd_vel` topic to control the robotâ€™s movement.
